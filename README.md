# OpenDLB Project
The main goals of OpenDLB project include:

1. Design and develop a set of open-source deep learning benchmarks for both training and inferencing.

2. Publish research papers and technical reports to show the performance of different modern hardware with the defined benchmarks. 

3. Involve more community members to join the project and build up an open-source deep learning benchmark standard.
